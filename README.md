# PHP

Each folder is a deifferent project done by me using PHP.
If you navigate to any of the projects below you will find a database inside it "FILE_NAME.SQL"
This file should be excuted in PhpMyAdmin before you see the actual project.
Also i have lots of tips and topics on instagram so follow me.
If you have any questions just contact me :
